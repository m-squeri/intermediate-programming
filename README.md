# intermediate-programming
A repository to showcase my work in Intermediate Programming at Johns Hopkins University in Spring 2023.

Due to university plagarism policies I am unfortunately unable to upload any source code for my projects.

I am nevertheless happy to display my work in the content of this repo!

## Chess

I created this Chess game for my final project of this course with the support of my teammates John Lu and Bill Wang as well as course staff!

This game was developed entirely in C++ and received an A, passing all public and hidden tests for the course.

Our game features a fully-functional suite of exception handling to prevent any illegal moves, making any scenario created or loaded by our game realistic!

Our game wields the popular 1-3-3-5-9 point system for each pawn, bishop, knight, rook, and queen respectively (each player begins with 39 points uncaptured).

White's pieces are capitalized, while black's are lowercase. The game generates a new board for each move, making it easy to view move history.
